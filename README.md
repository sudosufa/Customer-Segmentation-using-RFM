# Sudosufa Customer Segmentation using RFM

This project focuses on customer segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis method. Customer segmentation is a vital strategy for businesses to understand their customers better and tailor marketing and service efforts accordingly.

## Overview

- **Recency (R):** Measures how recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency (F):** Quantifies how often a customer buys.
- **Monetary (M):** Reflects how much money a customer spends.

The RFM analysis is a powerful technique to classify customers into meaningful segments, such as:
- **High-Value Customers:** High R, F, and M.
- **Loyal Customers:** High F and M, moderate R.
- **Churning Customers:** Low F and M, high R.

This project includes data preprocessing, RFM calculation, customer segmentation, and visualization to facilitate marketing strategies.

## Features
